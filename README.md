I wanted to make my project able to test a car driving in a certain temperature that effects the 
engine temperature. It was suppossed to be able to meassure the temperature of
 the engine and tell you that it is overheating or if it has overheated.

 Looking at the c++ code feels like a different language in your examples so I followed as best as I could.
 Alas, the program isn't working at all. It is not recognizing the variables and function I set forth 
 in refernced files.
 I just have to work harder and study for this class more.
 Also, My got repository and my Virtual machine is not properly configured.
 I tried to follow the instructions in the Syllabus as best as I could but it still wasn't working so I am directly uploading this from my files to git hub. 
 I hope it works
