  On January 13th, 2018, Hawaii's recidents recieved a fake missile warning from the government and sent the entire island
  into chaos.  The cause was a simple mistake on the security personel who run the missile alert system.
  The missile alert was activated because there was a simple drop down menu with a few different choices including the TEST 
  MISSILE WARNING and the REAL MISSILE WARNING. So my program was meant to put some more security into a system like this.
